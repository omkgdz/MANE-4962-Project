# Machine Learning for Solving Mega Airports Aircrafts Conjunctions
The project will be focusing on using machine learning to come up with solutions of relieving air-traffic conjunctions in mega airports such as JFK and lAX without having new infrastructures being built. 
The result will be providing aircrafts instructions of taxing route and landing or takeoff procudure that can best reduce the delays of the whole airport.
